## Problem
The problem is to find a pair of integers in a given set S = {a1, a2, ..., an} of n integers, such that the sum of the pair equals another integer in the same set S.

## Solution Overview

The solution approach taken in the `hasSum function` involves iterating over all possible pairs of integers in the vector and storing the sums of each pair in an unordered map. The function takes a vector of integers nums as input, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not a valid solution was found. Within the function, a nested loop is used to iterate over all possible pairs of integers in nums. For each pair, the sum of the two integers is calculated and stored in an unordered map sums.

If a sum is found that has already been seen before, the program checks to see if the corresponding indices of the two pairs are different, indicating that a valid solution has been found. If no such solution exists, the program outputs a message indicating that no such sum was found.

The time complexity of this solution is `O(nÂ²)` due to the nested loop used to iterate over all possible pairs of integers. This means that the program may take a long time to execute for very large input vectors. Additionally, the use of an unordered map to store sums and their corresponding indices can lead to collisions and degraded performance in some cases.
