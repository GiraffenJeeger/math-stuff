## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to complex mathematical problems written mostly in C++. The problems involve various branches of mathematics such as calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and number theory. The solutions are solved using various mathematical techniques in conjunction with programming.

## Contents

The repository contains the following folders:

-   `special_sequence`: This folder contains the solution to find the N-th element in a special sequence of numbers.

## Dependencies

The solutions are implemented in C++ and require a C++ compiler. You can install a C++ compiler such as g++ on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Usage

To run a solution, first compile the corresponding C++ file using the C++ compiler:

    g++ -o problem1 problem1.cpp

This will create an executable file `problem1` that you can run:

    ./problem1

 

The output of the solution will be printed to the console.
