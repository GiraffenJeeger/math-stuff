## Problem
The problem is to find the N-th number in a special sequence generated by selecting only the positive integers that are relatively prime to all the previously selected numbers up to a given input value. To solve this, we need to iteratively generate the sequence and find the next number that meets the criteria until we have the N-th element.

## Solution Overview

The solution to this is solved by the following steps:

1.  Generate the sequence of numbers S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}, where n is a positive integer.
2.  Initialize an empty sequence T to hold the numbers that are relatively prime to all numbers in T.
3.  Find the N-th element in the sequence T by iteratively adding the next number x from S that is relatively prime to all numbers in T, until the length of T equals N.

The implementation of this solution involves creating the following functions:

-   `int gcd(int a, int b)`: Computes the greatest common divisor of two positive integers a and b.
-   `std::vector<int> generate_sequence(int n)`: Generates the sequence S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}.
-   `int find_next_number(const std::vector<int>& sequence)`: Finds the next number in the sequence S that is relatively prime to all numbers in the given sequence.

These functions are defined in separate header and implementation files for better code organization and modularity.
